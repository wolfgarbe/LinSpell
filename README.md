# LinSpell
Fast Spelling correction & Approximate string search

The LinSpell spelling correction algorithm does not require edit candidate generation or specialized data structures like BK-tree or Norvig's algorithm. In most cases LinSpell is faster and requires less memory compared to BK-tree or Norvig's algorithm.
LinSpell is language and character set independent.

#### Applications

* Query correction (10â€“15% of queries contain misspelled terms),
* Chatbots,
* OCR post-processing,
* Automated proofreading.

#### Frequency dictionary
The [word frequency list](https://github.com/wolfgarbe/symspell/blob/master/wordfrequency_en.txt) was created by intersecting the two lists mentioned below. By reciprocally filtering only those words which appear in both lists are used. Additional filters were applied and the resulting list truncated to &#8776; 80,000 most frequent words.
